# A literature overview of code-modulated evoked potential (c-EP) brain-computer interfacing (BCI)
This repository provides an overview of literature on the code-modulated evoked potential (c-EP) across various sensory domains, including visual (c-VEP), auditory (c-AEP), and somatosensory (c-SEP). The literature is primarily presented within the context of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) applications.

## Definition
In this overview, *c-EP* is defined as any study employing non-periodic, pseudo-random stimulation, known as *noise tagging*. This approach is contrasted with two other evoked response paradigms. First, it differs from event-related potential (ERP) protocols, such as the *oddball* paradigm that elicits the P300 response. ERP protocols generally operate on a slower timescale and engage more cognitive rather than early sensory responses. Second, c-EP is distinct from paradigms using periodic stimulation, or *frequency tagging*, which elicits steady-state evoked potentials (SSEP).

## Diclaimer
This overview aims to provide a comprehensive summary of all published *c-EP* literature. However, the maintainer cannot guarantee that no studies have been overlooked or that updates are always made promptly. Readers are warmly encouraged to contribute to its completeness. If you notice any missing studies or find inaccuracies or omissions in existing entries, please submit an issue to ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
